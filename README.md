Introduction 

This project aims to analyse a dataset spanning the years 2000 to 2015 for different countries, focusing on factors influencing life expectancy, including mortality rates, health-related indicators, and the classification of countries as developed or developing. Unlike previous studies that examined data for a single year, this analysis covers multiple years, providing a more comprehensive view of trends over time. By identifying key factors that contribute to lower life expectancy, this study can offer insights to help countries prioritize specific areas for improvement in order to enhance the overall well-being and longevity of their populations.

Objectives

•	To evaluate the impact of adult mortality, infant mortality, and associated factors on life expectancy
•	Examine the connection between economic factors (GDP) and life expectancy based on a country’s development status
•	Identify the main predictors of life expectancy and offer insights for policy recommendations focused on enhancing population longevity.
•	Determine which countries need attention based on their life expectancy rates and those that do not
•	Compare the prevalence of various infections between developed and developing countries.

Insights and Analysis

The analysis clearly shows that developed countries have a higher life expectancy compared to developing nations. The possible reasons for this include the following
1.	Healthcare access and quality: better access to medical services and improved healthcare infrastructure significantly increase life expectancy.
2.	Nutrition and diet: Adequate and balanced nutrition, along with access to clean water, helps prevent malnutrition and related diseases.
3.	Economic stability: Higher income levels and economic growth (measured by GDP) provide resources for better healthcare, housing, and sanitation.
4.	Public health policies: Effective government policies on immunization, sanitation, and disease prevention can significantly reduce mortality rates.
5.	Technological advancements: Improvements in medical technology, such as vaccines and treatments for diseases, lead to better health outcomes.
6.	Environmental factors: clean air, reduced pollution, and safe living environments contribute to better health and longer lives.
7.	Reduced infant mortality: Lowering the rates of infant deaths has a direct impact on average life expectancy.


Conclusion

Through the use of various visualization methods, we can better understand how a developed country influences life expectancy, largely due to the availability of the factors mentioned. These techniques help identify correlations between causes of death that affect life expectancy. However, the attributes impacting life expectancy are not limited to this dataset, so additional factors like education and lifestyle should be considered for more accurate predictions.
